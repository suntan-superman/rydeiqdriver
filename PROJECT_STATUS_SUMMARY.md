### üîß Android Build Fixes Applied

#### **Issue:** AndroidX/Support Library Conflicts
**Root Cause:** Old `com.android.support:support-compat:28.0.0` libraries conflicting with AndroidX

**Solutions Applied:**

1. **Dependency Updates** ‚úÖ
   - Updated `expo` to `~53.0.23`
   - Downgraded `@react-native-community/slider` to `4.5.6`
   - Downgraded `@stripe/stripe-react-native` to `0.45.0`

   - Added yarn resolution: `@expo/config-plugins: ~10.1.1`

2. **Jetifier Configuration** ‚úÖ
   - Enabled in `app.json` via `expo-build-properties` plugin
   - Added explicit gradle flags in `eas.json`: `-Pandroid.useAndroidX=true -Pandroid.enableJetifier=true`

3. **Custom Config Plugin** ‚úÖ
   - Created `plugins/withAndroidManifestFix.js`
   - Sets `android:appComponentFactory` to AndroidX value
   - Adds `tools:replace` to override old support library

**Modified Files:**
- `app.json` - Added Jetifier config and custom plugin
- `package.json` - Updated dependencies and added resolutions
- `eas.json` - Added gradle flags for Jetifier

## üìã Phase 2 Voice Commands - Ready to Implement

### **Priority 1: Scheduled Ride Reminders** üéØ
**Impact:** HIGH | **Effort:** MEDIUM | **Driver Value:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Feature:** Proactive voice notifications for upcoming scheduled rides

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Background service monitoring scheduled rides
2. Notifications at 1 hour and 15 minutes before pickup
3. Voice announcements with ride details
4. Optional voice command to confirm/view details

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `src/services/scheduledRideReminderService.js` (NEW)
- `src/screens/dashboard/HomeScreen.js` (integrate service)

---

### **Priority 2: Active Ride Status Updates**
**Impact:** HIGH | **Effort:** LOW | **Driver Value:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Voice Commands:**
- "How far to pickup?" / "Distance to pickup"
- "How much time left?" / "ETA"
- "What's the fare?" / "Current fare"

**Implementation:**
- Extend `voiceCommandService.js` with new context: `active_ride`
- Add handlers in `ActiveRideScreen.js`
- Integrate with existing ride state

---

### **Priority 3: Navigation Integration**
**Impact:** MEDIUM | **Effort:** LOW | **Driver Value:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Voice Commands:**
- "Navigate to pickup"
- "Navigate to destination"
- "Start navigation"

**Implementation:**
- Deep link to Google Maps/Apple Maps
- Simple voice command recognition
- Add to `ActiveRideScreen.js`

---

## üîç Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Voice Message Cut Off by Sound ‚úÖ FIXED
**Solution:** Added 2-second `setTimeout` delay in `HomeScreen.js` before calling `speechService.speakNewRideRequest()`

### Issue 2: Pickup Location Says "Undefined" ‚úÖ FIXED
**Solution:** Modified `speakNewRideRequest` call to pass `newRideRequest.pickup?.address` and `newRideRequest.destination?.address` explicitly

### Issue 3: Event Toggles Not Working in Rider App ‚úÖ FIXED
**Solution:** Fixed naming mismatch - modal was accessing `settings.eventSettings` instead of `settings.events`

### Issue 4: Rating/Acceptance Buttons Too Large ‚úÖ FIXED
**Solution:** Reduced `statCard`, `statValue`, and `statLabel` styles by 20%
